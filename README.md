Encrypted Chat Room
This is a secure chat room application that uses LDAP authentication server, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and RSA encryption to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of all communication within the chat room.

LDAP Authentication Server
The chat room uses an LDAP server for user authentication. This means that users must provide a valid username and password to access the chat room. This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that only authorized users can access the chat room.

PKI and RSA Encryption
The chat room uses PKI and RSA encryption to secure all communication within the chat room. PKI is used to manage the public and private keys used for encryption and decryption, while RSA encryption is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. This ensures that even if someone intercepts the communication, they will not be able to read it without the proper decryption key.

How to use
Install the chat room on your device.
Open the chat room and enter your LDAP credentials (username and password) to log in.
Once logged in, you will be able to join or create a chat room.
All communication within the chat room is encrypted and can only be read by those who have the decryption key.
Conclusion
This encrypted chat room provides a secure way for users to communicate with each other, keeping all conversations private and confidential. With the added security of LDAP authentication and encryption, users can have peace of mind knowing that their communication is protected.
